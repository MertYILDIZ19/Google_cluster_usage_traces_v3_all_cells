# Google cluster usage traces v3 all cells

A large dataset of workload measurements has been released by Google for the month of May 2019. This robust collection details user requests and the corresponding utilization of cloud resources, totaling a significant 2.4TB in size. It encompasses data from eight distinct data centers, as delineated in the subsequent table. For a more granular breakdown of the trace data and its various components, please refer to the detailed documentation provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10r6cnJ5cJ89fPWCgj7j4LtLBqYN9RiI9/view).

In our pursuit to enable more efficient computational resource management, we have conducted an extensive analysis of the dataset. The result is a curated set of data, meticulously preprocessed to extract only the most pertinent information for advancing dispatching and scheduling algorithms.

### Column Descriptions:

- **Job_ID**: A unique identifier for each job, represented by a hashed number assigned by Google. Each job may encompass multiple tasks.
- **Task_ID**: The index of individual tasks within a job. For example, J_1 and J_2 are jobs each consisting of a single task (indexed as 0), while J_3 is a job comprising tasks indexed as 0 and 1, and J_4 includes tasks indexed as 0, 1, and 2.
- **Arrival_Time**: The time at which jobs are received, recorded in milliseconds. It is presumed that all tasks under a job arrive concurrently.
- **CPU_Usage**: The CPU resources each task requires for execution.
- **Memory_Usage**: The amount of memory resources required for each task.
